# ONE WAY ANNOVA :- 

ANOVA tells you if there are any **statistical differences between the means of three or more independent groups.**

### Limitations of one-way ANOVA

A one-way ANOVA tells us that at least two groups are different from each other. But it won’t tell us which groups are different. 

If our test returns a significant f-statistic, we may need to run a post-hoc test to tell us exactly which groups have a difference in means.
